# END-TO-END-DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECT


This project is submitted as **Task 3** for the **CODTECH Data Science Internship**. It demonstrates a simple **end-to-end data science pipeline** using a manually created dataset and a basic rule-based prediction model — without using any external libraries like `scikit-learn`.
Internship Credentials Company : CodTech IT Solutions

Name : Mohamed Fadhil U.F

Intern ID : CITSOD822

Domain : Data Science

duration: 4 weeks

mentor : neela santhosh

## 📌 Task Objective

> **Task 3**: Develop a full data science project, from data collection and preprocessing to model deployment using Flask or any logic-based prediction method.



## 🚀 Project Description

This project includes:
- 📊 Manual dataset creation (flower measurements)
- 🔄 Basic preprocessing
- 🤖 Rule-based classification logic
- 🧪 Sample prediction
- ✅ Works in any online compiler (no dependencies)

---

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of flower features including:

| Sepal Length | Sepal Width | Petal Length | Petal Width | Class       |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| 5.1          | 3.5         | 1.4           | 0.2          | setosa      |
| 7.0          | 3.2         | 4.7           | 1.4          | versicolor  |
| 6.3          | 3.3         | 6.0           | 2.5          | virginica   |
| ...          | ...         | ...           | ...          | ...         |

## 🧠 Model Logic

Since external ML libraries are not used, the model uses **simple rule-based classification** based on **petal length**:
