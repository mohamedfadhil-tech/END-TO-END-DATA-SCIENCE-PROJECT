# END-TO-END-DATA-SCIENCE-PROJECT


This project is submitted as **Task 3** for the **CODTECH Data Science Internship**. It demonstrates a simple **end-to-end data science pipeline** using a manually created dataset and a basic rule-based prediction model — without using any external libraries like `scikit-learn`.

## 📁 Dataset

The dataset consists of flower features including:

| Sepal Length | Sepal Width | Petal Length | Petal Width | Class       |
|--------------|-------------|---------------|--------------|-------------|
| 5.1          | 3.5         | 1.4           | 0.2          | setosa      |
| 7.0          | 3.2         | 4.7           | 1.4          | versicolor  |
| 6.3          | 3.3         | 6.0           | 2.5          | virginica   |
| ...          | ...         | ...           | ...          | ...         |
